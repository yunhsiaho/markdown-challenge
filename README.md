   ## A funny story

   When I was 1 yrs-old, one time in winter, my parents wrapped me in heavy clothes before going out, which made me look like a ball. Just when we went on a hill, I fell down and rolled down straightly to the bottom of the hill then across a big road. And surprisingly I didn't hurt at all:)

   ### TL;DR 
   #### too young too die lol
