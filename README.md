   This should contain a bullet list of your hobbies
    At least on item should contain a sublist, for example if you like movies, maybe make a sublist of some movies you really like.

   ##You can always count on me when you need someone to talk to... (smaller header)

   

   Tell your teammates which positive contribution to the group you will make.
    This could be technical, making people feel comfortable, being an organiser...

   ##A funny story (smaller header)

   When I was little, one time in winter,my parents wrapped me in heavy clothes to avoid me catching cold, which made me look like a ball. When we go on a hill, I fell and rolled down just until the bottom of the hill. And surprisingly I didn;t hurt at all:)

   TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)
    ###What a miracle
    Summarise your funny story in one short sentence.

   ! IMPORTANT -> At the bottom of the page there should be a next and previous link, this should link to the page of the previous student (alphabetically) and the next one.
    Organise yourself so it is easy to know who you should link to.

   The links should have the following structure:

   << previous || YOUR NAME || next >>
